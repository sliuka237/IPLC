## Cons of Leadpages

### 1. **Occasional Editor Quirks**
While the drag-and-drop editor is simple to use, it can sometimes be a bit finicky. Minor slowdowns or design adjustments may require patience to fine-tune.

### 2. **Limited Customization on Standard Templates**
The standard templates are less flexible compared to the drag-and-drop options. This can be frustrating if youâ€™re aiming for a highly unique design.

### 3. **Pricing**
Leadpages isnâ€™t the cheapest option on the market. Monthly fees can add up, and features like A/B testing are only available on higher-tier plans, which may not suit small businesses on a tight budget.
